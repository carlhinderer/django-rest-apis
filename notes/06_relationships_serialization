CHAPTER 6 - ADVANCED RELATIONSHIPS & SERIALIZATION
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Defining Requirements for a Complex RESTful Web Service

    - We are going to define a RESTful web service for registering components for drones that are
        grouped into drone categories.  These are the resources we will need:

        1. Drone categories (DroneCategory model)
        2. Drones (Drone model)
        3. Pilots (Pilot model)
        4. Competitions (Competition model)


        DroneCategory [name]
        Drone [DroneCategory FK, name, manufacturing_date, has_competed, created_date]
        Pilot [name, gender, number_of_races, created_date]
        Competition [Pilot FK, Drone FK, distance(ft), date]


    - Here are the operations we will support:

        HTTP verb       Scope                               Semantics
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                              list of URLs for each drone resource that belongs to the drone 
                                                              category.

        GET             Collection of drone categories      Retrieve all the stored drone categories in the collection, sorted by 
                                                              their name in ascending order. Each drone category must include a list 
                                                              of URLs for each drone resource that belongs to the drone category.

                                                              competitions, sorted by distance in descending order. The list must include 
                                                              all the details for the competition in which the pilots and his related 
                                                              drone participated.

        GET             Competition                         Retrieve a single competition. The competition must include the pilot's name that 
                                                              made the drone reach a specific distance and the drone's name.

        GET             Collection of competitions          Retrieve all the stored competitions in the collection, sorted by distance in 
                                                              descending order. Each competition must include the pilot's name that made the

        DELETE          Competition                         Delete an existing competition.



    - Here are the actual URIs we need to support:

        Scope                                     URI
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Collection of drone categories            /drone-categories/

        Drone category                            /drone-category/{id}

        Collection of drones                      /drones/

        Drone                                     /drone/{id}

        Collection of pilots                      /pilots/

        Pilot                                     /pilot/{id}

        Collection of competitions                /competitions/

        Competition                               /competition/{id}



    - Note that the HTTP PUT method is used to replace an entire resource, and the HTTP PATCH method is used
        to update one or more fields of an existing resource.



- Creating a New App with Django

    # In restful01 project directory
    $ python manage.py startapp drones



- Configuring a New Web Service

    # drones/apps.py
    from django.apps import AppConfig 

    class DronesConfig(AppConfig): 
        name = 'drones'


    # Add to restful01/settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = [ 
        'django.contrib.admin', 
        'django.contrib.auth', 
        'django.contrib.contenttypes', 
        'django.contrib.sessions', 
        'django.contrib.messages', 
        'django.contrib.staticfiles', 
        # Django REST framework 
        'rest_framework', 
        # Drones application 
        'drones.apps.DronesConfig', 
    ] 



- Defining Many-to-One Relationships with models.ForeignKey

    - Here are our models:

        from django.db import models 
 
 
        class DroneCategory(models.Model): 
            name = models.CharField(max_length=250) 
         
            class Meta: 
                ordering = ('name',) 
         
            def __str__(self): 
                return self.name 
         
         
        class Drone(models.Model): 
            name = models.CharField(max_length=250) 
            drone_category = models.ForeignKey( 
                DroneCategory, 
                related_name='drones', 
                on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
            manufacturing_date = models.DateTimeField() 
            has_it_competed = models.BooleanField(default=False) 
            inserted_timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) 
         
            class Meta: 
                ordering = ('name',) 
         
            def __str__(self): 
                return self.name 
         
         
        class Pilot(models.Model): 
            MALE = 'M' 
            FEMALE = 'F' 
            GENDER_CHOICES = ( 
                (MALE, 'Male'), 
                (FEMALE, 'Female'), 
            ) 
            name = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=False, default='') 
            gender = models.CharField( 
                max_length=2, 
                choices=GENDER_CHOICES, 
                default=MALE, 
            ) 
            races_count = models.IntegerField() 
            inserted_timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) 
         
            class Meta: 
                ordering = ('name',) 
         
            def __str__(self): 
                return self.name 
         
         
        class Competition(models.Model): 
            pilot = models.ForeignKey( 
                Pilot, 
                related_name='competitions', 
                on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
            drone = models.ForeignKey( 
                Drone, 
                on_delete=models.CASCADE) 
            distance_in_feet = models.IntegerField() 
            distance_achievement_date = models.DateTimeField() 
         
            class Meta: 
                # Order by distance in descending order 
                ordering = ('-distance_in_feet',)



- Running Migrations that Generate Relationships

    - We're going to switch to using Postgres instead of SQLite.

        # Create a new Postgres database
        $ sudo -u postgres createdb drones


        # Create database user and add 
        $ psql

        >>> CREATE ROLE username WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
        >>> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE drones TO username;
        >>> ALTER USER username CREATEDB;
        >>> \q


    - We need to update the settings.py:

        DATABASES = { 
            'default': { 
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql', 
                'NAME': 'drones', 
                'USER': 'username', 
                'PASSWORD': 'password', 
                'HOST': '127.0.0.1', 
                'PORT': '5432',       # 5432 is default
            } 
        }


    - Remove the toys urls from the 'restful01/urls.py' so migrations won't be run:

        urlpatterns = [
        ]


    - Install psycopg2:

        $ pip install psycopg2


    - Create and run migrations:

        $ python manage.py makemigrations drones
        $ python manage.py migrate



- Analyzing the Database

    # List the tables in the database
    $ psql --username=username --dbname=drones --command="\dt"

     Schema |            Name            | Type  |  Owner   
    --------+----------------------------+-------+----------
     public | auth_group                 | table | username
     public | auth_group_permissions     | table | username
     public | auth_permission            | table | username
     public | auth_user                  | table | username
     public | auth_user_groups           | table | username
     public | auth_user_user_permissions | table | username
     public | django_admin_log           | table | username
     public | django_content_type        | table | username
     public | django_migrations          | table | username
     public | django_session             | table | username
     public | drones_competition         | table | username
     public | drones_drone               | table | username
     public | drones_dronecategory       | table | username
     public | drones_pilot               | table | username
    (14 rows)


    # List the contents of each of our tables
    $ psql --username=username --dbname=drones --command="SELECT * FROM drones_dronecategory;"
    $ psql --username=username --dbname=drones --command="SELECT * FROM drones_drone;"
    $ psql --username=username --dbname=drones --command="SELECT * FROM drones_pilot;"
    $ psql --username=username --dbname=drones --command="SELECT * FROM drones_competition;"



- Configuring Serialization and Deserialization with Relationships

    - The 'HyperlinkedModelSerializer' is a type of ModelSerializer that uses hyperlinked relationships
        instead of primary key relationships.  It represents the relationship to other model instances
        with hyperlinks.

        # drones/serializers.py
        from rest_framework import serializers 

        from drones.models import DroneCategory 
        from drones.models import Drone 
        from drones.models import Pilot 
        from drones.models import Competition 
        import drones.views 
         
         
        class DroneCategorySerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer): 
            drones = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField( 
                many=True, 
                read_only=True, 
                view_name='drone-detail') 
         
            class Meta: 
                model = DroneCategory 
                fields = ( 
                    'url', 
                    'pk', 
                    'name', 
                    'drones')


    - The many=True, read_only=True indicates that the relationship is 1:M and read-only.  

    - The view_name='drone-detail' indicates to the browsable API to use the drone detail view to render
        the hyperlink when it is clicked.



- Defining Hyperlinks with serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer

- Working with Class-Based Views

- Taking Advantage of Generic Classes and Viewsets

- Generalizing and Mixing Behavior

- Working with Routing and Endpoints

- Making Requests that Interact with Resources that have Relationships
