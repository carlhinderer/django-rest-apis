- Defining Requirements for a Complex RESTful Web Service

    - We are going to define a RESTful web service for registering components for drones that are
        grouped into drone categories.  These are the resources we will need:

        1. Drone categories (DroneCategory model)
        2. Drones (Drone model)
        3. Pilots (Pilot model)
        4. Competitions (Competition model)


        DroneCategory [name]
        Drone [DroneCategory FK, name, manufacturing_date, has_competed, created_date]
        Pilot [name, gender, number_of_races, created_date]
        Competition [Pilot FK, Drone FK, distance(ft), date]


    - Here are the operations we will support:

        HTTP verb       Scope                               Semantics

                                                              category.

        Drone category                            /drone-category/{id}

        Collection of drones                      /drones/

        Drone                                     /drone/{id}

    - Note that the HTTP PUT method is used to replace an entire resource, and the HTTP PATCH method is used
        to update one or more fields of an existing resource.
